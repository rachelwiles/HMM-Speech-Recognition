A matrix, B matrix and time steps must be added to read_initialmatiricies 
before use. 

Run in the following order:

1) read_initialmatricies
2) calc_B
3) calc_forward
4) calc_backward
5) get_occupationlikelihoods
6) reestimate_meanvariance
7) gauss_graph
8) get_transitionlikelihoods
9) reestimate_A

Output results displayed in accompanying report.

File retrain.m may be used to perform many iterations of above procedure.
